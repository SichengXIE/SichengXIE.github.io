Benefits
======
During this project I learned how to cooperate with teammates and how to lead teammates to fight for a same target. In the meantime, I improved my java skills epically in my coding logic thinking. Understand how to use API
and how to make a big project working efficiency.


Conclusion
======
A lovely robot who can map the boundary by himself and find an item on
the map was made with the cooperation of our group. Itâ€™s a challenge to my coding skill, logical thinking and talking, and cooperation abilities as well.
